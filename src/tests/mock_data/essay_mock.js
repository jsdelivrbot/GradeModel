        Golding uses the actions of Jack when becoming a hunter during, and after hunting for pigs to show Golding commentary of  humans are unable to act violent towards another, but can only change their nature as a result of the environment. When Jack first went hunting, he found a pig which he hurled the spear” at only to have  '“The patterning of pig trotters died away in the distance.” Jack missed the kill on the pig, which shows Golding commentary. If Jack didn't go alone and worked harder for a stronger spear, he could have killed the pig, but didn’t because he doesn’t want to think about how he took a living creature life himself. However, by letting the fire go out when a ship came by, the twins were carrying “The gutted carcass of a pig.” Jack and the hunters finally killed a pig, which shows Golding commentary. In a environment were the only protean you get is from living animals, the environment forces the children to kill, who shouldn’t be experienced or doing these types of things in the first place at such a young age.

        I got the couch!  Just you listen! Piggy is extremely anger and has started screaming and yelling at everyone just to get his point across, which shows Golding commentary. Because of the tension of the environment, and since everyone wants to go home and be safe, it causes Piggy not to be physically violent but to get verbal violent so he can help everyone think properly so they can go home as quick as possible. When Piggy states that he could never get a count on how many people there were, Jack just told him to “shut up.” Jack is getting more violent towards Piggy, which shows Golding commentary. Jack says this phrase more to anyone on this island meaning that he is tired of listening to one of the oldest complain a lot, meaning he isn’t thinking straight since Piggy is only trying to help regain stability until help comes. </div>
